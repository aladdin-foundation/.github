ðŸŒŸ Overview

Aladdin is a decentralized agent marketplace where users can hire on-chain agents with transparent pricing, escrow-based payments, and verifiable reputation.
The goal is to create a trustless environment for collaboration between users and Web3 agents.

This project starts with a smart contract that manages agent registration, engagements, and payment settlement in USDT. Future versions will extend to include reputation systems, dispute resolution, and DAO-based governance.
